To develop:
1. Get legal moves from pseudo-legal moves, by making all legal moves for every piece and checking if any piece lands on the King's square.
2. When in check, only the king can be moved, or any piece can be moved to block the check.
3. Concept of pinning.
4. (Not important) Fix the thin white lines on border of window.

Bugs:


v0.2.0-alpha
1. Move rules defined, capturing is now possible
2. Piece highlighting on selection
3. Implement a check function
4. Sounds for every move
Bug fixes:
1. Program crash on Pawn reaching end of board, Fix OutOfBounds for rank and file in moves.py
2. Legal moves getting wrong, now will work to make them return string.
3. When king is captured, the program will work wrongly. (Fixed - Now it will throw a custom error)
